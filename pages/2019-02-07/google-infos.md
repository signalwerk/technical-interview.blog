To help prepare for a potential Google Recruiting Process, sharing documents and websites, as well as our **Guide to interviewing at Google** (PDF) which has more information in view of your technical interview. It contains great tips about how our process works, candidates who review and practice with this do considerably better in their interview.  

As shared on the phone, the recruiting process ahead of you looks like this:

0\. Preparation time, study & practice → **you are here**  
**1.** Hangouts Technical Interview (1 interview x 45 mins)  
**2.** Onsite Interviews (4-5 interviews x 45 mins in a Google office)  
**3\.** Team Matching (~1 week)    
**4.** EMEA Hiring Committee review (~1 week)    
**5.** US Hiring Committee & Offer Review (~1-2 weeks)  

## Next step - Hangouts Technical Interview  

This is a 45 minutes Technical Interview with a Google Software Engineer over Hangouts. The interviewer will share with you a Google Doc and will be interested in your knowledge of computer science principles (for this step, you should know **Big-O** really well, along with data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, trees and hash tables to name a few) and how it is applied in your solutions. Our engineers want you to demonstrate that you can comprehend and solve the problem quickly with clean, efficient, optimal code. 

## Interview Questions

Interview topics may cover anything from coding questions, building and developing complex algorithms and analyzing their performance characteristics, logic problems, systems design and core computer science principles - hash tables, stacks, arrays, etc. Computer Science fundamentals are a prerequisite for all engineering roles at Google, due to the complexities and global scale of the projects you would end up participating in.
