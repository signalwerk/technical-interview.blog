## Clunky start
Today I had an Interview with a google Tech Recruiter. That went super bad I have to say... During the last couple Weeks I hade more than one Job Interview where I was looking for a Web-Frontend Developer position. And in general there was never a Question about my technical competence. But today after a 10 Minute call with the Recruiter, I realised that to work at google you probably need a degree in computer science to face the challanges. Especially they are not looking for FE-Devs but for Fullstack people who can work efficient on a global scale. 
When the firendly guy asked me on the phone for the first «test question» about what would be the Big-O for some kind of Sort-Algorythm (can not even rememver the name) I at least understood the question but was miles away from giving a clever answer. He was still kind and send me in the follow up mail some links and Informations. Let's see what I'll make out of it...
